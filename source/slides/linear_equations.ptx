    <title>Linear Equations in One Variable</title>
<p>Linear Equations in One Variable A linear equation in one variable is any 
    equation of the form <me>ax+b=c</me> where <m>a, b,</m> and <m>c</m> 
    are real numbers, <m>a\ne0</m> and <m>x</m> is an unknown variable.</p>
    <p>These types of equations are also called <alert>first-degree equations</alert>.
    </p>
    <p>Solving Linear Equations To solve linear equations:
    <ol>
      <li><p>Simplify each side of the equation by removing grouping symbols and 
        combining like terms.</p></li>
      <li><p>Use the Addition Property of Equality to get the variable terms on 
        one side and constants on the other.</p></li>
      <li><p>Use the Multiplication Property of Equality to isolate the variable.</p></li>
      <li><p>Check your answer.</p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>The check is not part of the solution so should not be written, however you 
    should always check your answer and make not if the answer does not work 
    (is extraneous).</p>
<p>Solve the following.
    <m>5(2x-1)=3(1-x)+5x</m> </p>
<p>Solve the following.
    <m>\frac{2x-3}{2}+\frac{7}{4}=\frac{8x+1}{4}</m>
</p>
<p>Things to Remember when solving Equations

    <ul>
      <li><p>There should be exactly one equal sign in your equations</p></li>
      <li><p>Each step of your solution should follow from the previous step</p></li>

      <li><p>Try to get in the habit of not writing intermediate calculations or 
        things not actually part of the solution.</p></li>
      <li><p>Steps of your solution should be written in a vertical format</p></li>
      <li><p>It is okay for variables to cancel out:</p></li>
    </ul>
