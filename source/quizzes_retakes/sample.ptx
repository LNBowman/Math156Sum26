  <introduction>
    <p>
      <alert>Instructions:</alert> This is a sample quiz designed to give you practice 
      on how to upload your work.  This quiz is not part of your grade but you are welcome 
      to try it out to see what your timed quizzes will be like and how to upload your work.  
      If you would like feedback on your submission, please submit you work by May 20. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you open the quiz, your timer begins.  I would recommend having an additional timer
        that goes off about 5 minutes prior, so that you know when to start uploading your work.
