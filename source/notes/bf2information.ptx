  <title>BF-2 Linear Forms of Lines</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      For this outcome we will be looking at relations in two variables.  
      We will look at how to visualize points, lines, and other curves, 
      and how to identify intercepts.  We will look at linear equations 
      in two variables and discuss the different forms that can be used 
      to describe them.  We will also look at slope (rate of change) and 
      how that can be used to work with linear equations.  Specifically, 
      for this outcome, students should be able to:
      <ul>
        <li><p>For any line be able to write the equation in:
          <ul>
            <li><p>point-slope form.</p></li>
            <li><p>slope-intercept form.</p></li>
            <li><p>standard form.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Given a point and a slope:
          <ul>
            <li><p>Write the equation of the line.</p></li>
            <li><p>Graph the equation of the line.</p></li>
            <li><p>State the intercepts or other points on the line.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Given two points:
          <ul>
            <li><p>Find the slope of the line between the points.</p></li>
            <li><p>Find the equation of the line between the points.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Given a line:
          <ul>
            <li><p>Find the equation that is parallel to the given line.</p></li>
            <li><p>Find the equation that is perpendicular to the given line.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </p></li>

  <title>Slope</title>
  <p>Slope (or the steepness) of a line can be thought of as rise over run.  
    Give, two points on the line, <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m> then 
    slope can be written as: <m>m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</m></p>
    <note><p>No slope <m>\ne</m> Zero slope <m>\ne</m> Undefined slope.</p>
      <p>These all represent different things.</p></note> 
      <p>Every line has a slope, so the term <em>no slope</em> does not make 
        sense when referring to a line. <em>Zero slope</em> refers to horizontal 
        lines where <m>y_2=y_1</m> so <m>m=0</m>. <em>Undefined slope</em> 
        refers to vertical lines where <m>x_2=x_1</m> so <m>m</m> is undefined.</p>
       <p>Positive slope means that the line increases as <m>x</m> increases or 
        that the line rises to the right. Negative slope means that the 
        line decreases as <m>x</m> increases or that the line falls to the right</p>
        <p>If <m>m_1</m> is the slope of line 1, and <m>m_2</m> is the slope of
          line 2. Then:
          <ul>
            <li><p>line 1 and line 2 are parallel if <m>m_1=m_2</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>line 1 and line 2 are perpendicular if <m>m_1=-\frac{1}{m_2}</m>.</p></li>
          </ul>
  </p>

    <title>Forms of Linear Equations</title>
    <p>There are three main forms for the equation of a line.</p><p><em>Standard form</em>
       is <m>Ax+BY=C</m> where <m>A, B</m>, and <m>C</m> are integers and <m>A\gt 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>The point-slope form is useful when you know the slope <m>m</m> and
      a point, <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, on the line.  The point-slope form is given as
    <m>y-y_1=m(x-x1)</m></p>
    <p>The slope-intercept form is most commonly used to graph a line. For this form,
      we need the slope <m>m</m> and the y-intercept <m>(0,b)</m>.  The slope-intercept 
      form is given by <m>y=mx+b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>There are also two special cases for lines; horizontal and vertical lines, which
      correspond to our specific slopes.  For a horizontal line <m>m=0</m> so any form 
      of the equation can be reduced to <m>y=b</m> where <m>(0,b)</m> is the y-intercept. 
      For a vertical line, <m>m</m> is undefined. So any form of the equation, can be 
      reduced to <m>x=a</m> where <m>(a,0)</m> is the x-intercept.
