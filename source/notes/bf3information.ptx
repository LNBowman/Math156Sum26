  <title>BF-3 Difference Quotients and Piecewise Functions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      For this outcome we will be looking at relations and functions.  
      We will evaluate functions (specifically looking at average rate 
      of change and the difference quotient).  We will also look at graphs 
      of basic functions and discuss properties of functions. We will 
      look at how these can be broken up and combined to form piecewise 
      functions. Specifically, for this outcome, students should be able to:
      <ul>
        <li><p>Use and understand function notation.</p></li>
        <li><p>Find and interpret a function's average rate of change over an
          interval.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Set up an evaluate various types of difference quotients.</p></li>
        <li><p>Given a piecewise function:
          <ul>
            <li><p>State the simplified domain in interval notation.</p></li>
            <li><p>Find the intercepts.</p></li>
            <li><p>Find and label the boundary points.</p></li>
            <li><p>Graph the function with correct notation on the boundary points, 
              correct slope, and general behavior of the graph. 
            </p></li>
          </ul>
        </p></li>

  <title>Functions</title>
  <p>A function is a set of ordered pairs that have the property that no input value 
    has more than one corresponding output value. We denote a function using the name 
    of the function, the domain variable, and the expression. <m>f(x)=2x+3</m> is an
    example of a function named <m>f</m>, with domain variable <m>x</m>, defined by the
    expression <m>2x+3.</m></p>
  <p>To evaluate a function we can replace the domain variable with the number or 
    expression to be evaluated.</p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Difference Quotients</title>
    <p>The difference quotient is another way to represent an average rate of change.
      Typically this average rate will be measured over an interval, so given an 
      interval <m>[a,b]</m> and a function <m>f(x)</m> we say that the average rate
      of change of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> is given by <m>ARC=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</m>.
      If we don't have the full interval but know the function and the change, <m>h</m>,
       we can write this as <m>ARC=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>.</p>
    <p>The difference quotient can be written in various forms but will always be a change 
      in the function value divided by the change in the domain values.

    <title>Piecewise Functions</title>
    <p>A piecewise function (or piecewise defined function) is a function defined by 
      multiple subfunctions, each applying to a subset of the overall domain. </p>
      <p>How to Graph a Piecewise Function
        <ol>
          <li><p>Identify Intervals: Determine the <m>x</m>-intervals for each piece.</p></li>
          <li><p>Graph Each Piece: Sketch each individual formula (e.g., lines, 
            parabolas) only within its specified interval.</p></li>
          <li><p>Check Boundaries: Use a filled circle <m>\bullet</m> for <m>\le</m> or 
            <m>\ge</m> (included) and an open circle <m>\circ</m> for <m>\lt</m> or
            <m>\gt</m> (excluded).</p></li>
          <li><p>Verify Continuity: Note if the graph has breaks (discontinuities) 
            or connects between intervals.</p></li>
        </ol>
