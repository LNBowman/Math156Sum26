    <title>Linear Equations </title>
    <p>An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that relates two algebraic 
      expressions involving at lest one variable.</p>
    <p>The solution set for an equation is the set of elements in the domain of 
      the variable that make the equation true.  (Each element of the solution set 
      is a solution or root)</p>
      <p>An equation is called an identity if the equation is true for all elements 
        in the domain of the variable. An equation is called conditional if it 
        is true for certain domain values and false for others. Two equations are 
        equivalent if the solution set is the same for both equations.</p>
        <p>Properties of Equality: For any real number a, b and c, we have the following properties
          <ol>
            <li><p>Addition Property:<m>\text{If }a=b\text{ then }a+c=b+c</m></p></li>
            <li><p>Subtraction Property:<m>\text{If }a=b\text{ then }a-c=b-c</m></p></li>
            <li><p>Multiplication Property:<m>\text{If }a=b\text{ then }ac=bc</m></p>
            <p>(We assume that here <m>c \ne 0</m></p></li>
            <li><p>Division Property:<m>\text{If }a=b\text{ then }\frac{a}{c}=\frac{b}{c}</m></p>
            <p>(We assume that here <m>c\ne 0</m></p></li>
            <li><p>Substitution Property: <m>\text{If }a=b</m> then either can be used to
            replace the other in any statement without changing the truth value of the 
            statement.</p></li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Any equation that can be written in the form  is considered a linear, 
          first-degree equation in one variable.</p>

    <title>Absolute Value Equations</title>
    <p>The distance on the number line between zero and a number, <m>x</m> is 
      the absolute value of x, denoted <m>|x|</m>.</p><p> Note: Absolute value of a number
        is never negative, as it represents a distance.</p>
        <p>When solving absolute value equations we need to consider when the 
          distance is both positive and negative. So if we had an equation
          <m>|ax+b|=c</m> we can rewrite this as two equations, by dropping the 
          absolute value and setting the expression equal to the positive and negative 
          distance. <me>ax+b=c \text{ and }ax+b=-c</me></p>

    <title>Quadratic Equations</title>
    <p>Quadratic equations can be written as <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> where <m>a, b,</m> 
      and <m>c</m> are constants and <m>a\ne0</m>. There are four different methods
      that can be used to solve a quadratic equation.
      <ol>
        <li><p>Factoring:</p><p>Here the idea is to move all terms to one side of
          the equal sign and set the other side equal to <m>0</m>.  Factoring the 
          terms we want to try and get either <m>x(ax+b)=0</m> or <m>(ax+b)(cx+d)=0</m>.
          These two forms will allow us to use the <em>Zero Property of Equality</em> to 
          solve. This property says: If <m>m(n)=0\text{ then either }m=0\text{ or }n=0</m>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Extraction of Roots:</p><p>This method is most useful if our quadratic is
          in the form <m>(ax+b)^2=c</m>.  Here we can take the square root of both sides 
          to "extract the roots" from <m>c</m>. We can then solve the two resulting linear
          equations.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Quadratic Formula:</p><p>Given <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m> we can use the formula
        <m>x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</m> to find the values.</p><p><m>b^2-4ac</m>
        is known as the discriminant which tells the types of solutions you should expect 
      from the equation.
        <ol>
          <li><p>if <m>b^2-4ac \gt 0</m> then there are two distinct real roots.</p></li>
          <li><p>if <m>b^2-4ac=0</m> then there one real double root.</p></li>
          <li><p>if <m>b^2-4ac \lt 0</m> then there are two imaginary roots.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </p></li>
        <li><p>Completing the Square:</p><p> This method is most useful in rewriting
          the quadratic in vertex form.  The idea is to use perfect square trinomial, 
          and the properties of equality to rewrite the quadratic into the form 
          <m>a(x-h)^2+k</m> where <m>(h,k)</m> is the vertex of the quadratic.
        </p></li>
      </ol>
