    <title>Math F156X Precalculus Spring 2026 Course Syllabus</title>
      <blockquote><p> This is a 4-credit course. This course requires both in-person 
      (proctored testing) and online components. If you do not have a 
      testing center nearby, please work with Testing Services to set up 
      proctoring. If you do not have reliable internet, you will need to 
      make arrangements to access and submit course materials. In this course, 
      we will use a mastery-based assessment format instead of the traditional 
      percentage-based system. This assessment style will give you a clearer 
      picture of the expectations in our course, how well you have mastered the 
      course material, and how you can improve your understanding (and your grade!). 
      Throughout the course, you will be given opportunities to develop your skills, 
      assess these skills, and relearn material to improve your understanding.  
      We will have online homework, written quizzes, and proctored assessments. Every 
      problem on a quiz or assessment will be mapped to one of the course standards. 
      In addition to these assignments, you will also be asked to complete engagement 
      activities throughout the course.</p>
      <p>The key ideas of mastery-based learning are:
        <ul>
          <li>You will either receive credit or need to reassess; There are no 0 grades unless you do not try;</li>
        <li>You will be given many opportunities to improve your understanding and your score;</li>
        <li>Non-mastery items are based on completion;</li>
        <li>Once you have attained a minimum grade you can only improve.</li>
        </ul>

      <alert>Class Meetings</alert>
      This is an asynchronous online course so there are 
            no class meeting times, however, you will need to set up times with your 
            proctor to take assessments.

      <alert>Course Description</alert>
      Various classes of functions and their graphs are explored numerically, 
            algebraically and graphically. Function classes include polynomial, 
            rational, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric. Skills and concepts 
            needed for calculus are emphasized. This class is intended for students 
            intending to take MATH F251X.

              <li><p> Canvas - Canvas is our Learning Management System (LMS).  
                This is basically where you will find all of the resources for 
                this course (videos, readings, due dates, quizzes, practice, and 
                your feedback). It is also a good place to collaborate with your peers.
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                Gradescope - an online tool we will use to submit quizzes, review 
                feedback, and store your graded work.  You can access Gradescope through 
                any of the links in Canvas or by going to gradescope.com and logging in 
                with your school credentials. Gradescope is free for your use.

              <li><p>
                 Flatworld and eText - We will use Precalculus v3.0 by Edward Burger. 
                 The ebook and HW access can be purchased through the bookstore for 
                 about $39.99 (plus bookstore markup). Links to the course software and 
                 ebook will be included in the Canvas modules so that you will not need 
                 separate login information. You should not expect to buy a physical 
                 textbook for this course unless you want a print version (this is an 
                 additional cost through the bookstore). Be aware that you will have 2 
                 weeks of free access to this software before you need to purchase access, 
                 so everyone will be able to access the material on the first day of class.
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                 Airtable access -  In the first week of class, you will receive an email 
                 allowing you access to the Airtable Grade Progress page (this link will also 
                 be in Canvas). You will want to bookmark this link. This link will provide 
                 you with information about your course progress throughout the semester.

                 Digitizing materials.  For some of the work in this course, you will need to 
                 take pictures of your work or create a PDF of your solutions and upload them. 
                 You are welcome to use the course apps if you do not have other means for 
                 digitizing your work.

                  Proctor for assessments.  If you are in the Fairbanks area, you will be expected 
                  to take your assessments at the UAF Testing Services located on the 6th floor of 
                  the Rasmuson Library.  If you are not in the Fairbanks area, you will need to 
                  find a proctor. For all assessments in this course, you will need to schedule them 
                  in advance and ensure you take them within the required dates.<em>You will need to
                    set up your proctor in the first week of class, as your proctor will need to be 
                    approved by Testing Services prior to any materials being sent.

                  This course tests the student’s ability to apply mathematical methods.  Many of 
                  these methods require basic algebra skills as well as some computations necessary 
                  for Calculus. Students should get into the habit of simplifying answers and writing 
                  out exact solutions. This means that while working through the course, some problems 
                  may require the use of a graphing calculator or other computer graphing system, 
                  students should get into the habit of writing out exact solutions and using the 
                  calculator only when specifically asked to round an answer or to get approximate 
                  answers for complicated expressions. You will be expected to show specific methods 
                  and computations. <em>Calculators are NOT allowed on any quiz or assessment. The use 
                    of a calculator on either of these items is a form of academic dishonesty and will 
                    result in an automatic grade of N on that assignment and possible disciplinary 
                    action for repeated offenses.</em>
