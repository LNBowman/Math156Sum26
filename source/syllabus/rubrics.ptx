    <title>Rubrics, Schedules, and Grades</title>
    <p> We will use a few rubrics for this course.  You will be given rubrics on class assignments, and 
      you will have access to all of the rubrics in Canvas. Here is the rubric for what is meant by Mastery.  
      For quiz and assessment outcomes in this class, your grade will be one of the following: M, P, R, N.

  <p>Quizzes this semester will be given every Tuesday and Friday. The assessments will open on one of those days in 
    weeks when we have only one quiz.  Here are the assessment dates and coverage for the semester.</p>

        <title>Grade Computation</title>
        <p>
          There are 16 content outcomes to be mastered twice (1 quiz and 1 assessment, or 2 
          assessments), 35 video lessons, 35 Flatworld assignments, 14 engagements, 7 tutoring 
          appointments, and 1 Instructor appointment in this course. The possible grades 
          earned in this course, in order from lowest to highest, are</p>
          <p>F D C C+ B- B B+ A- A A+</p>
          <p>Your base grade (A, B, C, D, F) is determined by Quiz mastery, Assessment mastery, 
            and Flatworld completion. For the base grade, you will need:</p>
            <p>10 outcomes with a score of at least M, all the rest at P for both quizzes and 
              assessments, complete the instructor appointment, and 29 flatworld to have a base 
              grade of A;</p>
              <p>All outcomes with a score of at least P for both quizzes and assessments, 
                complete the instructor appointment, and 25 flatworld to have a base grade of B;</p>
              <p>9 outcomes with a score of at least P, all the rest at R for both quizzes and 
                assessments, complete the instructor appointment, and 21 flatworld to have a base 
                grade of C;</p>
              <p>All outcomes with a score of at least R for both quizzes and assessments, and 
                17 flatworld to have a base grade of D;</p>
              <p>If you have not met the above requirements, then your base grade would be an F</p>
              <p><em>If your base grade is an F, the highest grade you can earn in this course 
                is a D. If your base grade is a D, then the highest grade you can earn in this 
                course is a C.</em></p>
              <p>If you have at least 25 video lessons, your base grade would be one grade higher. 
                If you have at least 19 video lessons, then your base grade would remain the same. 
                If you have fewer than 19 video lessons, your base grade would be one grade lower.</p>
              <p>If you have credit for at least 4 appointments, your base grade would move one 
                grade to the right. If you have credit for at least two appointments, your base 
                grade will remain the same. If you have fewer than 2 appointments, your base grade 
                would move one grade to the left.</p>
              <p>If you have at least 10 engagements, then your base grade would go one grade to 
                the right. If you have at least 7 engagements, then your base grade would remain 
                the same. If you have fewer than 7 engagements, then your base grade would go one 
                grade to the left.</p>
