      <alert>Correspondence with the Instructor</alert></p><p>
      Students who email the instructor with a question should expect a 
      response within 24 hours (if you are emailing after 5 pm or on weekends, 
      you should expect a response after 9 am the following business day). 
      <em>Emails should be from a UA email address and include the student's first 
      and last name, the course they are in, and a clearly stated question.</em> 
      Emails without this minimal information will not receive responses. Emails 
      should maintain a professional tone; emails containing inappropriate material 
      or language will be ignored and, in extreme cases, sent to the 
      <url href= "mailto:uaf-orca@alaska.edu">Office of 
      Rights, Compliance, and Accountability</url> for further action.
      </p>
    <p>
      <alert>RSI Policy</alert></p><p>
      To be compliant with federal law and Northwest Commission on Colleges and 
      Universities (NWCCU) accreditation requirements, UAF faculty must ensure 
      that all courses in which faculty and students are not physically located 
      in the same space, for which students use federal financial aid, have regular 
      and substantive interaction (RSI) between students and instructors. Regular 
      refers to scheduled, predictable interactions. Substantive refers to engaging 
      students in teaching, learning, and assessment, consistent with course content.
    </p>
    <p>As your faculty member, I have included the following actions in the course 
        to meet RSI requirements: 
      <ul>
        <li><p>Meeting with each student in the first 3 weeks of the course</p></li>
        <li><p>Providing feedback on quizzes and assessments</p></li>
        <li><p>Providing opportunities for students to ask questions by 
            allowing individual appointments</p></li>
        <li><p>Providing individualized grade checks throughout the semester</p></li>
        <li><p>Providing reflection opportunities that allow for student questions</p></li>
      </ul>  
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Academic Integrity Policy</alert></p><p>
      As described by UAF, scholastic dishonesty constitutes a violation of the 
      university's rules and regulations and is punishable in accordance with 
      the procedures outlined by UAF. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited 
      to cheating on any assignment, plagiarism, and collusion. Cheating includes 
      providing answers to or taking answers from another student or source, using 
      non-allowed materials on an assessment (such as calculators or phones). Plagiarism 
      consists of the use of another author’s words or arguments without attribution. 
      Collusion includes unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing 
      written work to fulfill any course requirement. Scholastic dishonesty is punishable 
      by a zero on the assignment for the first offense and a second offense removal from 
      the course with a grade of “F.” For more information, go to

    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>AI Policy</alert></p><p>
      This course requires completion of various assignments that assess understanding 
      and application of the course content. Students are expected to do their own work. 
      Students are not allowed to use any artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as 
      text generators, paraphrasers, summarizers, mathematical solvers, or mathematical 
      graphing tools, to complete any part of their reflections, discussions, quizzes, or 
      assessments.  These tools can help with understanding practice materials. Using AI 
      tools for reflections, discussions, quizzes, or assessments is considered academic 
      dishonesty. It will result in a grade of N for the assignment and may lead to 
      disciplinary action. If you have any questions about what constitutes acceptable use 
      of AI tools, please consult the instructor before submitting the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Grade Reporting</alert></p><p>
      UAF has various grade reporting processes to help students stay on track and 
      make informed decisions about course progress toward degree completion. The UAF 
      Early Warning, Midterm, and Withdrawal grade reports are reported in Nanook Navigator 
      and UA Online and are sent out to advisors and observers. In addition, a Grade 
      Progress link has been provided in Canvas for students to monitor their progress. 
      Students will also receive regular progress reports through Airtable so that they 
      can see their progress throughout the semester.  It is the student's responsibility 
      to ask if there are questions about the grade or anything stated in a progress report. 
      These progress reports are also a time to review study habits and identify what may 
      need to be done to improve a grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Equity</alert></p><p>
      Mastery grading makes course expectations (assignments and grades) much clearer for 
      students. This can make unstated expectations visible and help instructors identify 
      and remove unnecessary requirements (such as those focused on compliance rather than 
      learning). For the students, mastery grading provides clear expectations of what is 
      needed to earn a particular grade. Outcomes and rubrics are provided in advance so 
      that those expectations are transparent.
    </p>
    <p>Mastery-based grading also allows students to take ownership of their learning. 
        Grades here are based on showing your understanding or on making mistakes and 
        learning from them.  Everyone learns at different paces, and mastery learning 
        allows the opportunity to spend more time on areas that you have difficulty with 
        and less time on areas that you know.

      absences are defined as missed classes or coursework by students beyond what is 
      permissible by the instructor’s written course policies. Students may need to miss class 
      and/or coursework for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li><p>Bereavement</p></li>
        <li><p>Personal illness or injury</p></li>

        apply, you will need to notify your instructor. If you are dealing with any 
        of the above and are not able to work on this class for more than four 
        consecutive days, you will need to work with the Office of Rights, Compliance, 
        and Accountability to see about your options for continuing in the course.
