      <title>Video Lessons</title>
      <p>Within each lesson, you will be given a reading assignment and example videos.  
        The example videos have short quiz problems to help you gauge your understanding 
        of the basics of the concept. These video lessons are part of your completion score 
        in this course. These quiz problems in the videos are used to check understanding 
        of what was read and watched.  The video quizzes are graded on completion, and you 
        must complete at least 19 of them to earn a passing grade.  While these assignments 
        have due dates, they can be submitted late, and the last day to submit them for 
        credit is Monday, August 3, 2026.</p>

      <title>Flatworld Assignments</title>
      <p>Before taking a quiz on a topic, you should complete the Flatworld assignment. This 
        will provide a look at the foundational concepts needed for the topic and a general 
        understanding of what you will be assessed on. This is your daily homework in this course, 
        and you will need to complete a minimum number of these assignments to earn a specific 
        letter grade. Each Flatworld assignment must be completed by a specific date, but it can 
        be started at any time. These assignments provide students with the opportunity to practice 
        routine problems and receive immediate feedback on correctness.</p>
      <p>While working through these assignments, it would be beneficial to take notes and keep 
        work organized. This will help in reviewing material, working with tutors, and preparing 
        for the assessments. Also, while working, ask questions. Write down any problems or questions 
        that arise, and meet with a tutor or schedule an appointment with a TA or the instructor. 
        If something is not understood, ask.  If there are questions about the direction to go or 
        the method to use, ask. There are many resources available to help in understanding the material.</p> 
        <p>If a Flatworld assignment deadline is missed, these can still be completed for partial 
          credit. <em>Extensions do not need to be requested; they are automatic.</em> Flatworld 
          assignments can be submitted for credit up until Monday, August 3, 2026. </p>

      <title>Practice Opportunities</title>
      <p>In Canvas, you will find practice quizzes that will provide some practice for each of the 
        learning outcomes. Each practice quiz can be completed as many times as needed to practice 
        the material. In addition to these quizzes, it is highly recommended that you work through 
        some of the problems at the end of the Flatworld sections. This will help in solidifying 
        foundational knowledge. Flatworld also has additional videos and practice sets that can be
        used for further study. In each of the introduction pages, I have also added links to different
        CheckIt banks that you can use to review concepts. <em>The practice materials are just that, for 
          practice.  These assignments do not affect your grade and these are not included in the 
          module time expectations.</em>

      <title>Mastery Quizzes</title>
      <p>We will have 1-2 mastery quizzes per week.  For every learning outcome, there will be a quiz. 
        (Note that there are some concepts in this course that are preliminary and will not be quizzed.  
        While these are important in building a mathematical foundation, not everything will be assessed.)
         Each quiz will be due after looking at the material and after the Flatworld assignment is due.  
         Each quiz will be given a grade of M (mastered), P (progressing), R (reassessing), or N (not 
         assessable), and will be returned within 24 hours. You will have a set time limit for each quiz 
         and will need to have your digitizing materials nearby to upload your work. The time limit 
         posted includes about 5 minutes to digitize and upload your work. If the time limit expires 
         and you do not upload any work in Gradescope, you will earn an N on the quiz and need to retake 
         it. <em>All of the quizzes are in Gradescope and work must be submitted in Gradescope to receive 
          credit.</em></p>
    <p>Students will receive their graded quizzes to review and identify any errors or misconceptions. 
      These quizzes will be graded on content, format, notation, and mathematical writing.  Part of the 
      student learning outcomes of this course is for students to demonstrate understanding of 
      mathematical notation, write clear mathematical solutions, and communicate mathematics concisely.  
      This is equivalent to being able to write essays of a certain length with correct grammar, 
      punctuation, and style structure. </p>
      <p>Math is inherently comprehensive. If there is confusion about a concept, do not skip it, as 
        that will only make later lessons more difficult to complete. It is the student's responsibility 
        to get help with the material so that the quizzes and assessments can be completed on time, even 
        if the Flatworld assignments are submitted late. The Mastery Quizzes will not be accepted after 
        the due date. If you miss a quiz date, you will earn an N on that quiz for that attempt. </p>

      <title>Tutoring</title>
      <p>I require that students complete a minimum of 4 tutoring appointments during the semester. 
        These appointments will appear in Canvas.  There are seven tutoring windows in the course.  
        If you have earned an M or P on all of the quizzes in that tutoring window, you will automatically 
        earn credit for that tutoring window.  If you have earned an R or N on any quiz during that 
        tutoring window, you will need to complete a tutoring appointment.  The tutoring appointment 
        must be scheduled and attended for a minimum of 30 minutes, one-on-one with a tutor, either 
        in-person or through Zoom. <em>Drop-in tutoring sessions will NOT count towards these 
          appointments.</em> These appointments need to be scheduled and completed through the 
          Math Services Appointment Tutoring (link is in Canvas) to earn credit. Students should use 
          their UA credentials to create and attend appointments. </p>
          <p>If there are questions about concepts, tutors are available to help with understanding. 
            In addition, as this is an asynchronous course, there are no set meetings between students; 
            however, discussion of math concepts is essential to improving mathematical vocabulary and 
            understanding, as well as creating inquiry. These appointments are graded on completion.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Revisions and Retakes</title>
      <p>If you score an M on a quiz, you are done and ready to move on to the next topic. If 
        you score a P on the quiz, you can either keep this score or revise your work to try to 
        earn an M. The revisions have set due dates and will not be accepted after that time. 
        <em>All of the work for the revisions must be submitted in Canvas to receive 
          credit.</em> If you earn an R or N on the quiz, then you will be allowed a retake. You will 
        be required to do some practice problems, complete a tutoring appointment to go over the 
        concepts in that module, and you will be given a new version of the quiz. The retakes have set 
        due dates and should be submitted through Canvas. <em>All of the work for the revisions must 
          be submitted in Canvas to receive credit.</em></p>

      <title>Assessments</title>
      <p>We will have five assessments and a final during the semester. You will have the opportunity 
        to assess many of the outcomes up to 3 times. If you are not ready for a particular concept, 
        no worries, leave it blank and try it on the following assessment.  If you are away during an 
        assessment for university- or military-sponsored events, you will need to schedule a time before 
        leaving to complete the assessment. If you miss an assessment window without making previous 
        arrangements, you can attempt mastery on the following assessment or on the final (depending on
        which topics are available in the next assessment). All assessments are proctored, so you will 
        need to <em>set up your proctor in the first week of class</em>. You will need to schedule your 
        assessments through UAF Testing Services at least 3 days in advance of the testing window, so 
        you will need to plan accordingly. Assessments will be available during the windows as outlined 
        below.  Students who have not scheduled these appointments or have not requested materials by 
        the deadline will miss the chance to take that assessment. If a student is outside Fairbanks, 
        appointments with the proctor/testing center at their location must be made in addition to the 
        request for materials from UAF Testing Services.</p>
