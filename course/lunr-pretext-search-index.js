  "body": " Course Information    Math F156X Precalculus Spring 2026 Course Syllabus  This is a 4-credit course. This course requires both in-person (proctored testing) and online components. If you do not have a testing center nearby, please work with Testing Services to set up proctoring. If you do not have reliable internet, you will need to make arrangements to access and submit course materials. In this course, we will use a mastery-based assessment format instead of the traditional percentage-based system. This assessment style will give you a clearer picture of the expectations in our course, how well you have mastered the course material, and how you can improve your understanding (and your grade!). Throughout the course, you will be given opportunities to develop your skills, assess these skills, and relearn material to improve your understanding. We will have online homework, written quizzes, and proctored assessments. Every problem on a quiz or assessment will be mapped to one of the course standards. In addition to these assignments, you will also be asked to complete engagement activities throughout the course.  The key ideas of mastery-based learning are:  You will either receive credit or need to reassess; There are no 0 grades unless you do not try;  You will be given many opportunities to improve your understanding and your score;  Non-mastery items are based on completion;  Once you have attained a minimum grade you can only improve.       Instructor and Section Information  Instructor: Dr. Latrice Bowman Office: Chapman 301B  email: lnbowman@alaska.edu  phone: 907-474-5427 (you will find it easier to reach me through email)    Student Help Hours Hours are by appointment through Zoom. You can use Dr. Bowman's Appointment Scheduler to set up an appointment.   Class Meetings This is an asynchronous online course so there are no class meeting times, however, you will need to set up times with your proctor to take assessments.   Course Description Various classes of functions and their graphs are explored numerically, algebraically and graphically. Function classes include polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric. Skills and concepts needed for calculus are emphasized. This class is intended for students intending to take MATH F251X.   Prerequisite Placement or Instructor Permission.   Textbook and course materials   Canvas - Canvas is our Learning Management System (LMS). This is basically where you will find all of the resources for this course (videos, readings, due dates, quizzes, practice, and your feedback). It is also a good place to collaborate with your peers.  Gradescope - an online tool we will use to submit quizzes, review feedback, and store your graded work. You can access Gradescope through any of the links in Canvas or by going to gradescope.com and logging in with your school credentials. Gradescope is free for your use.  Flatworld and eText - We will use Precalculus v3.0 by Edward Burger. The ebook and HW access can be purchased through the bookstore for about $39.99 (plus bookstore markup). Links to the course software and ebook will be included in the Canvas modules so that you will not need separate login information. You should not expect to buy a physical textbook for this course unless you want a print version (this is an additional cost through the bookstore). Be aware that you will have 2 weeks of free access to this software before you need to purchase access, so everyone will be able to access the material on the first day of class.  Airtable access - In the first week of class, you will receive an email allowing you access to the Airtable Grade Progress page (this link will also be in Canvas). You will want to bookmark this link. This link will provide you with information about your course progress throughout the semester.  Digitizing materials. For some of the work in this course, you will need to take pictures of your work or create a PDF of your solutions and upload them. You are welcome to use the course apps if you do not have other means for digitizing your work.  Proctor for assessments. If you are in the Fairbanks area, you will be expected to take your assessments at the UAF Testing Services located on the 6th floor of the Rasmuson Library. If you are not in the Fairbanks area, you will need to find a proctor. For all assessments in this course, you will need to schedule them in advance and ensure you take them within the required dates. You will need to set up your proctor in the first week of class, as your proctor will need to be approved by Testing Services prior to any materials being sent.   This course tests the student’s ability to apply mathematical methods. Many of these methods require basic algebra skills as well as some computations necessary for Calculus. Students should get into the habit of simplifying answers and writing out exact solutions. This means that while working through the course, some problems may require the use of a graphing calculator or other computer graphing system, students should get into the habit of writing out exact solutions and using the calculator only when specifically asked to round an answer or to get approximate answers for complicated expressions. You will be expected to show specific methods and computations. Calculators are NOT allowed on any quiz or assessment. The use of a calculator on either of these items is a form of academic dishonesty and will result in an automatic grade of N on that assignment and possible disciplinary action for repeated offenses.       Course Learning Outcomes  When students leave this course, they should have a solid foundation that prepares them for a Calculus course. This means that students will have  acquired study habits and learning tools to prepare them for success in a math course;  a solid foundation in algebraic manipulation;  an ability to effectively communicate mathematics, both written and oral;  acquired methods to effectively evaluate one's work;  acquired knowledge of functions to model and analyze various mathematical situations.  To meet these course outcomes, students will be specifically assessed on the following standards:   Foundation Standards are assessed in all of the content modules   PF-1 Simplifying Algebraic Expressions  PF-2 Basics of Graphing Functions  PF-3 Problem Structure  PF-4 Mathematical Communication   Content Standards are assessed through the specific content modules   Basics of Functions   BF-1 Linear and Quadratic Equations  BF-2 Forms of Linear Equations  BF-3 Difference Quotients and Piecewise Functions  BF-4 Transformations and Combinations    Graphing Algebraic Functions   GR-1 Graphing Quadratic Functions and Models  GR-2 Graphing Polynomial Functions  GR-3 Graphing Rational Functions  GR-4 Systems  GR-5 Graphing Systems    Exponentials and Logarithms   EL-1 Graphing Exponential and Logarithmic Functions  EL-2 Exponential and Logarithmic Equations  EL-3 Exponential Models    Trigonometric Functions   TF-1 Right Triangle Applications  TF-2 Graphing Trigonometric Functions  TF-3 Trigonometric Equations  TF-4 Law of Sines and Cosines Applications      There will be concepts covered in this course that are necessary for understanding some of this content, which may be given in the course lectures and homework but will not be assessed formally.

  "title": "Course Components",
  "body": " Course Components   Video Lessons  Within each lesson, you will be given a reading assignment and example videos. The example videos have short quiz problems to help you gauge your understanding of the basics of the concept. These video lessons are part of your completion score in this course. These quiz problems in the videos are used to check understanding of what was read and watched. The video quizzes are graded on completion, and you must complete at least 19 of them to earn a passing grade. While these assignments have due dates, they can be submitted late, and the last day to submit them for credit is Monday, August 3, 2026.    Flatworld Assignments  Before taking a quiz on a topic, you should complete the Flatworld assignment. This will provide a look at the foundational concepts needed for the topic and a general understanding of what you will be assessed on. This is your daily homework in this course, and you will need to complete a minimum number of these assignments to earn a specific letter grade. Each Flatworld assignment must be completed by a specific date, but it can be started at any time. These assignments provide students with the opportunity to practice routine problems and receive immediate feedback on correctness.  While working through these assignments, it would be beneficial to take notes and keep work organized. This will help in reviewing material, working with tutors, and preparing for the assessments. Also, while working, ask questions. Write down any problems or questions that arise, and meet with a tutor or schedule an appointment with a TA or the instructor. If something is not understood, ask. If there are questions about the direction to go or the method to use, ask. There are many resources available to help in understanding the material.  If a Flatworld assignment deadline is missed, these can still be completed for partial credit. Extensions do not need to be requested; they are automatic. Flatworld assignments can be submitted for credit up until Monday, August 3, 2026.    Practice Opportunities  In Canvas, you will find practice quizzes that will provide some practice for each of the learning outcomes. Each practice quiz can be completed as many times as needed to practice the material. In addition to these quizzes, it is highly recommended that you work through some of the problems at the end of the Flatworld sections. This will help in solidifying foundational knowledge. Flatworld also has additional videos and practice sets that can be used for further study. In each of the introduction pages, I have also added links to different CheckIt banks that you can use to review concepts. The practice materials are just that, for practice. These assignments do not affect your grade and these are not included in the module time expectations.     Mastery Quizzes  We will have 1-2 mastery quizzes per week. For every learning outcome, there will be a quiz. (Note that there are some concepts in this course that are preliminary and will not be quizzed. While these are important in building a mathematical foundation, not everything will be assessed.) Each quiz will be due after looking at the material and after the Flatworld assignment is due. Each quiz will be given a grade of M (mastered), P (progressing), R (reassessing), or N (not assessable), and will be returned within 24 hours. You will have a set time limit for each quiz and will need to have your digitizing materials nearby to upload your work. The time limit posted includes about 5 minutes to digitize and upload your work. If the time limit expires and you do not upload any work in Gradescope, you will earn an N on the quiz and need to retake it. All of the quizzes are in Gradescope and work must be submitted in Gradescope to receive credit.  Students will receive their graded quizzes to review and identify any errors or misconceptions. These quizzes will be graded on content, format, notation, and mathematical writing. Part of the student learning outcomes of this course is for students to demonstrate understanding of mathematical notation, write clear mathematical solutions, and communicate mathematics concisely. This is equivalent to being able to write essays of a certain length with correct grammar, punctuation, and style structure.  Math is inherently comprehensive. If there is confusion about a concept, do not skip it, as that will only make later lessons more difficult to complete. It is the student's responsibility to get help with the material so that the quizzes and assessments can be completed on time, even if the Flatworld assignments are submitted late. The Mastery Quizzes will not be accepted after the due date. If you miss a quiz date, you will earn an N on that quiz for that attempt.    Tutoring  I require that students complete a minimum of 4 tutoring appointments during the semester. These appointments will appear in Canvas. There are seven tutoring windows in the course. If you have earned an M or P on all of the quizzes in that tutoring window, you will automatically earn credit for that tutoring window. If you have earned an R or N on any quiz during that tutoring window, you will need to complete a tutoring appointment. The tutoring appointment must be scheduled and attended for a minimum of 30 minutes, one-on-one with a tutor, either in-person or through Zoom. Drop-in tutoring sessions will NOT count towards these appointments. These appointments need to be scheduled and completed through the Math Services Appointment Tutoring (link is in Canvas) to earn credit. Students should use their UA credentials to create and attend appointments.  If there are questions about concepts, tutors are available to help with understanding. In addition, as this is an asynchronous course, there are no set meetings between students; however, discussion of math concepts is essential to improving mathematical vocabulary and understanding, as well as creating inquiry. These appointments are graded on completion.    Revisions and Retakes  If you score an M on a quiz, you are done and ready to move on to the next topic. If you score a P on the quiz, you can either keep this score or revise your work to try to earn an M. The revisions have set due dates and will not be accepted after that time. All of the work for the revisions must be submitted in Canvas to receive credit. If you earn an R or N on the quiz, then you will be allowed a retake. You will be required to do some practice problems, complete a tutoring appointment to go over the concepts in that module, and you will be given a new version of the quiz. The retakes have set due dates and should be submitted through Canvas. All of the work for the revisions must be submitted in Canvas to receive credit.    Assessments  We will have five assessments and a final during the semester. You will have the opportunity to assess many of the outcomes up to 3 times. If you are not ready for a particular concept, no worries, leave it blank and try it on the following assessment. If you are away during an assessment for university- or military-sponsored events, you will need to schedule a time before leaving to complete the assessment. If you miss an assessment window without making previous arrangements, you can attempt mastery on the following assessment or on the final (depending on which topics are available in the next assessment). All assessments are proctored, so you will need to set up your proctor in the first week of class . You will need to schedule your assessments through UAF Testing Services at least 3 days in advance of the testing window, so you will need to plan accordingly. Assessments will be available during the windows as outlined below. Students who have not scheduled these appointments or have not requested materials by the deadline will miss the chance to take that assessment. If a student is outside Fairbanks, appointments with the proctor\/testing center at their location must be made in addition to the request for materials from UAF Testing Services.   "

  "body": " Course and University Policies   Correspondence with the Instructor Students who email the instructor with a question should expect a response within 24 hours (if you are emailing after 5 pm or on weekends, you should expect a response after 9 am the following business day). Emails should be from a UA email address and include the student's first and last name, the course they are in, and a clearly stated question. Emails without this minimal information will not receive responses. Emails should maintain a professional tone; emails containing inappropriate material or language will be ignored and, in extreme cases, sent to the Office of Rights, Compliance, and Accountability for further action.   RSI Policy To be compliant with federal law and Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) accreditation requirements, UAF faculty must ensure that all courses in which faculty and students are not physically located in the same space, for which students use federal financial aid, have regular and substantive interaction (RSI) between students and instructors. Regular refers to scheduled, predictable interactions. Substantive refers to engaging students in teaching, learning, and assessment, consistent with course content.  As your faculty member, I have included the following actions in the course to meet RSI requirements:  Meeting with each student in the first 3 weeks of the course  Providing feedback on quizzes and assessments  Providing opportunities for students to ask questions by allowing individual appointments  Providing individualized grade checks throughout the semester  Providing reflection opportunities that allow for student questions     Academic Integrity Policy As described by UAF, scholastic dishonesty constitutes a violation of the university's rules and regulations and is punishable in accordance with the procedures outlined by UAF. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating on any assignment, plagiarism, and collusion. Cheating includes providing answers to or taking answers from another student or source, using non-allowed materials on an assessment (such as calculators or phones). Plagiarism consists of the use of another author’s words or arguments without attribution. Collusion includes unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing written work to fulfill any course requirement. Scholastic dishonesty is punishable by a zero on the assignment for the first offense and a second offense removal from the course with a grade of “F.” For more information, go to https:\/\/www.alaska.edu\/bor\/policy\/09.02-Student%20Rights%20and%20Responsibilities.pdf    AI Policy This course requires completion of various assignments that assess understanding and application of the course content. Students are expected to do their own work. Students are not allowed to use any artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as text generators, paraphrasers, summarizers, mathematical solvers, or mathematical graphing tools, to complete any part of their reflections, discussions, quizzes, or assessments. These tools can help with understanding practice materials. Using AI tools for reflections, discussions, quizzes, or assessments is considered academic dishonesty. It will result in a grade of N for the assignment and may lead to disciplinary action. If you have any questions about what constitutes acceptable use of AI tools, please consult the instructor before submitting the work.   Grade Reporting UAF has various grade reporting processes to help students stay on track and make informed decisions about course progress toward degree completion. The UAF Early Warning, Midterm, and Withdrawal grade reports are reported in Nanook Navigator and UA Online and are sent out to advisors and observers. In addition, a Grade Progress link has been provided in Canvas for students to monitor their progress. Students will also receive regular progress reports through Airtable so that they can see their progress throughout the semester. It is the student's responsibility to ask if there are questions about the grade or anything stated in a progress report. These progress reports are also a time to review study habits and identify what may need to be done to improve a grade.   Equity Mastery grading makes course expectations (assignments and grades) much clearer for students. This can make unstated expectations visible and help instructors identify and remove unnecessary requirements (such as those focused on compliance rather than learning). For the students, mastery grading provides clear expectations of what is needed to earn a particular grade. Outcomes and rubrics are provided in advance so that those expectations are transparent.  Mastery-based grading also allows students to take ownership of their learning. Grades here are based on showing your understanding or on making mistakes and learning from them. Everyone learns at different paces, and mastery learning allows the opportunity to spend more time on areas that you have difficulty with and less time on areas that you know.   ASUAF advocacy statement: The Associated Students of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the student government of UAF, offers advocacy services to students who feel they are facing issues with staff, faculty, and\/or other students, specifically if these issues are hindering the ability of the student to succeed in their academics or go about their lives at the university. Students who wish to utilize these services can contact the Student Advocacy Director by visiting the ASUAF office or emailing asuaf.office@alaska.edu .   Student Protections statement: The university respects and upholds the principles of due process and a fair and equitable process as specified in the Board of Regents' Policy 09.02 Student Rights and Responsibilities.

  "title": "How to Succeed in this Course",
  "body": " How to Succeed in this Course   Start on Time   It has been shown that when students set up their schedule and start online math courses on time, they are 90% more likely to succeed. Students who wait until the second week to start an online math course are only 60% likely to succeed, and those who begin in the third week succeed in the class only 6% of the time.  Set up a weekly schedule, designating specific times to work on this course. This will help ensure there is time to complete the assignments and get help as needed. A course schedule is available in Canvas to help you track your progress and outline what you should be working on daily.     Complete the Assignments   As this course is based on showing your understanding, you will need to complete the assignments and take advantage of opportunities to show your improvement on the material. Flatworld is both the text and the practice for this course. While you will be actively working and learning across various aspects of the course, additional exposure and practice will help you ask questions and understand the material.     Take Advantage of Retakes and Assessments   While it is possible that the goal for you is to get an A and master everything, do not be afraid to make mistakes. It is easy to think about the grade, but the focus should be on what parts of the concepts you understand and what you don’t. If you are not fully ready for a quiz or an assessment, THAT IS OKAY as long as you attempt, review any feedback, ask questions, and try again. The worst thing that you can do in this course is not to try. As mentioned, everyone learns at a different pace. Don’t judge your progress based on what others are doing. Find out what you need to work on, and use retakes and reassessments when you have areas that require further review.     Ask For Help   Math, like most things in life, can be hard. And like most things, we will make mistakes. The key is to learn from those mistakes. This may mean stepping outside of our comfort zones and asking for help. Questioning is a part of learning, and if everything were understood, then there would be no need to learn. Sometimes, we may not always know what we need help with or where to start. The tutors are there to support your learning and review foundational concepts. Your instructor is there to help guide you and help you understand how to problem-solve. The TAs are there to help clarify concepts and make connections. Your peers are there to collaborate and discuss ideas. In addition, there are many resources available to help this class succeed. As part of the course, students will be asked to work regularly with tutors. In addition, as we work through the course material, you may have difficulty with some concepts. Ask questions as they come up and seek help to get them answered     Consider Your Course Load  UAF’s academic catalog states that one credit hour is equivalent to 1 hour of classroom instruction (or 1.5 hours of laboratory\/active learning) and a minimum of 2 hours outside of class per week. This is a 16-week 4-credit asynchronous course, which means that you should expect to work on this course a MINIMUM of 2-2.5 hours per day, five days a week (or equivalent to 12 hours a week) to go through the reading material, practice, and graded assignments. Some students may need to spend more time than this to go through all the materials and fully understand the concepts, but students should not spend less than this. Students who have difficulty with the material or do not have the prerequisite facility may find they spend more time than this. In these cases, set up regular times with the tutors and schedule a meeting with the instructor.   "

  "body": " BF-1 Linear and Quadratic Equations   For this outcome we will be looking at one variable equations that are reducible to either a linear or a quadratic form. Specifically, for this outcome, students should be able to:  Determine if an equation is linear or quadratic  If it is a linear equation:  Use correct mathematical structure to write out steps progressing to a solution.  Use algebraic methods to remove grouping symbols and combine like terms.  Simplify algebraic expressions to obtain the solution.    If it is a quadratic equation:  Use correct mathematical structure to write out steps progressing to a solution.  Determine the most appropriate method for solving the quadratic, if a specific method is not requested.  Use algebraic methods to rewrite the quadratic expression (factoring, completing the square or setting up the quadratic formula.  Simplify algebraic expressions to obtain the solution.         Linear Equations  An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that relates two algebraic expressions involving at lest one variable.  The solution set for an equation is the set of elements in the domain of the variable that make the equation true. (Each element of the solution set is a solution or root)  An equation is called an identity if the equation is true for all elements in the domain of the variable. An equation is called conditional if it is true for certain domain values and false for others. Two equations are equivalent if the solution set is the same for both equations.  Properties of Equality: For any real number a, b and c, we have the following properties  Addition Property:  Subtraction Property:  Multiplication Property:  (We assume that here  Division Property:  (We assume that here  Substitution Property: then either can be used to replace the other in any statement without changing the truth value of the statement.    Any equation that can be written in the form is considered a linear, first-degree equation in one variable.    Videos  Here are the videos for this part of the learning outcome. Feel free to watch these as many times as you need to, to understand the content. You can also pause and rewind as needed.    Absolute Value Equations  The distance on the number line between zero and a number, is the absolute value of x, denoted . Note: Absolute value of a number is never negative, as it represents a distance.  When solving absolute value equations we need to consider when the distance is both positive and negative. So if we had an equation we can rewrite this as two equations, by dropping the absolute value and setting the expression equal to the positive and negative distance.    Videos  Here are the videos for this part of the learning outcome. Feel free to watch these as many times as you need to, to understand the content. You can also pause and rewind as needed.    Quadratic Equations  Quadratic equations can be written as where and are constants and . There are four different methods that can be used to solve a quadratic equation.  Factoring: Here the idea is to move all terms to one side of the equal sign and set the other side equal to . Factoring the terms we want to try and get either or . These two forms will allow us to use the Zero Property of Equality to solve. This property says: If .  Extraction of Roots: This method is most useful if our quadratic is in the form . Here we can take the square root of both sides to \"extract the roots\" from . We can then solve the two resulting linear equations.  Quadratic Formula: Given we can use the formula to find the values. is known as the discriminant which tells the types of solutions you should expect from the equation.  if then there are two distinct real roots.  if then there one real double root.  if then there are two imaginary roots.    Completing the Square: This method is most useful in rewriting the quadratic in vertex form. The idea is to use perfect square trinomial, and the properties of equality to rewrite the quadratic into the form where is the vertex of the quadratic.

We will look at how to visualize points, lines, and other curves, and how to identify intercepts. We will look at linear equations in two variables and discuss the different forms that can be used to describe them. We will also look at slope (rate of change) and how that can be used to work with linear equations. Specifically, for this outcome, students should be able to:  For any line be able to write the equation in:  point-slope form.  slope-intercept form.  standard form.    Given a point and a slope:  Write the equation of the line.  Graph the equation of the line.  State the intercepts or other points on the line.    Given two points:  Find the slope of the line between the points.  Find the equation of the line between the points.    Given a line:  Find the equation that is parallel to the given line.  Find the equation that is perpendicular to the given line.         Slope  Slope (or the steepness) of a line can be thought of as rise over run. Give, two points on the line, and then slope can be written as:  No slope Zero slope Undefined slope.  These all represent different things.  Every line has a slope, so the term no slope does not make sense when referring to a line. Zero slope refers to horizontal lines where so . Undefined slope refers to vertical lines where so is undefined.  Positive slope means that the line increases as increases or that the line rises to the right. Negative slope means that the line decreases as increases or that the line falls to the right  If is the slope of line 1, and is the slope of line 2. Then:  line 1 and line 2 are parallel if .  line 1 and line 2 are perpendicular if .      Forms of Linear Equations  There are three main forms for the equation of a line. Standard form is where , and are integers and .  The point-slope form is useful when you know the slope and a point, , on the line. The point-slope form is given as  The slope-intercept form is most commonly used to graph a line. For this form, we need the slope and the y-intercept . The slope-intercept form is given by .  There are also two special cases for lines; horizontal and vertical lines, which correspond to our specific slopes. For a horizontal line so any form of the equation can be reduced to where is the y-intercept. For a vertical line, is undefined. So any form of the equation, can be reduced to where is the x-intercept.   "

Functions  A function is a set of ordered pairs that have the property that no input value has more than one corresponding output value. We denote a function using the name of the function, the domain variable, and the expression. is an example of a function named , with domain variable , defined by the expression  To evaluate a function we can replace the domain variable with the number or expression to be evaluated.    Difference Quotients  The difference quotient is another way to represent an average rate of change. Typically this average rate will be measured over an interval, so given an interval and a function we say that the average rate of change of on is given by . If we don't have the full interval but know the function and the change, , we can write this as .  The difference quotient can be written in various forms but will always be a change in the function value divided by the change in the domain values.    Piecewise Functions  A piecewise function (or piecewise defined function) is a function defined by multiple subfunctions, each applying to a subset of the overall domain.  How to Graph a Piecewise Function  Identify Intervals: Determine the -intervals for each piece.  Graph Each Piece: Sketch each individual formula (e.g., lines, parabolas) only within its specified interval.  Check Boundaries: Use a filled circle for or (included) and an open circle for or (excluded).  Verify Continuity: Note if the graph has breaks (discontinuities) or connects between intervals.     "

  "body": " BF-4 Transformations and Combinations   For this outcome we will be looking at creating new functions by shifting, reflecting, stretching, or compressing a graph. We will also be combining two or more functions using algebraic operations and the evaluation of functions to create new functions. Specifically, for this outcome, students should be able to:  Given a transformed function, determine the basic function that was transformed.  Given two functions, identify the transformations that will change one function into the other.  Apply transformations in the correct order to move points on a graph.  Given a transformed graph and that of a basic function, determine the equation of the transformed graph.  Given two or more functions, be able to evaluate:  The sum or difference function.  The sum or difference function evaluated at a point.  The product or quotient function.  The product or quotient function evaluated at a point.  The composition function.  The composition function evaluated at a point.  The domain of any combination.         Transformations of Functions     Combinations of Functions     Compositions of Functions    "

These types of equations are also called first-degree equations .  Solving Linear Equations To solve linear equations:  Simplify each side of the equation by removing grouping symbols and combining like terms.  Use the Addition Property of Equality to get the variable terms on one side and constants on the other.  Use the Multiplication Property of Equality to isolate the variable.  Check your answer.    The check is not part of the solution so should not be written, however you should always check your answer and make not if the answer does not work (is extraneous).  Solve the following.   Solve the following.   Things to Remember when solving Equations  There should be exactly one equal sign in your equations  Each step of your solution should follow from the previous step  Try to get in the habit of not writing intermediate calculations or things not actually part of the solution.  Steps of your solution should be written in a vertical format  It is okay for variables to cancel out:    "
